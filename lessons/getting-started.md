## What This Course Is

This course is a high-level introduction to design systems. It will teach you the foundational skills your team needs to build a set of reusable components and standards.

## What This Course Is Not

This course is not a comprehensive overview to design systems. There is no industry-standard for what a design system truly is, and as a result it can be interpreted differently at different companies.

## Course Updates

If you find any mistakes, feel free to open a PR on the [course repository](https://github.com/emmabostian/fem-design-systems).
